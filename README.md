This is a clone of the FreeImage .NET project (http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/) modified to work with dotnet core

FreeImage native binaries are included in the nuget package for Windows, other platforms they will have to be installed separately (eg. on OSX `brew install freeimage` should work)

nuget package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/FreeImage-dotnet-core

`Install-Package FreeImage-dotnet-core -Pre`

The license is the same as the FreeImage license available at the link above
