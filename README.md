This is a clone of the FreeImage .NET project (http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/) modified to work with dotnet core

This does not include the FreeImage native binaries, on Windows they can be downloaded from the FreeImage website, on OSX `brew install freeimage` should work... haven't tried Linux yet...

nuget package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/FreeImage-dotnet-core/3.17.0-alpha1

`Install-Package FreeImage-dotnet-core -Pre`
